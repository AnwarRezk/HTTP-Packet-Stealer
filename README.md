# HTTP-Packet-Stealer
Sockets give us shear amounts of power, since in some sense you can control the behaviour of the process on the other end of the socket. With great power comes great responsibility, We’re learning some evil stuff to be aware of them and to find techniques to mitigate vulnerabilities. 
We’ll steal some HTTP information by making a program that listens to TCP packets then steals the data if it’s an HTTP request and displays that request.
